<p id="description">This project is a simple yet powerful keylogger implemented in python. A keylogger also known as keystroke logging or keyboard capturing is the action of recording (logging) the keys struck on a keyboard typically in a covert manner so that the person using the keyboard is unaware that their actions are being monitored. This keylogger captures keystrokes from the user's keyboard input providing a comprehensive record of all the keys pressed.</p>

<h2>üöÄ Project Demo</h2>

https://github.com/dhruvgadewar/Dhruv_keylogger/assets/163728245/edf34c5e-749a-430a-8154-6a41cdd78e44

<p>NOTE:- The file used in this Demo video is executable file made from these python code. you can directly run the python code on the editor.
          If you want to make the executable file of the code follow the following steps:
          step1: visit to the directory of your code.
          step2: open command prompt.
          step3: install pyinstaller using command : pip install pyinstaller
          step4: enter command : pyinstaller filename.py --onefile --noconsole 
          step5: check whether the executable file is created or not.</p>

  
<h2>üßê Features</h2>

Here're some of the project's best features:

*   Stealth Mode: The keylogger operates silently in the background without the user's knowledge
*   Keystroke Logging: Captures all keyboard inputs including special keys function keys and alphanumeric characters
*   Persistence: Automatically starts capturing keystrokes upon system boot
*   Log File Generation: Stores captured keystrokes in a log file for later analysis
*   Customization: Easily customizable codebase to tailor the keylogger according to specific requirements
